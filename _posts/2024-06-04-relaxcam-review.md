I was excited to try out the RelaxCam, hoping it would provide an affordable and reliable home security solution. Unfortunately, my experience with this camera has been anything but relaxing. 

From the moment I opened the box, I was disappointed. The camera's plastic casing felt flimsy and cheap, and the included instructions were difficult to follow. It took me several attempts to get the camera connected to my Wi-Fi network, and even then, the connection was inconsistent.

Once I finally got the camera up and running, I was disappointed by the poor video quality. The footage was grainy and pixelated, making it difficult to make out details. Additionally, the camera's motion detection was overly sensitive, resulting in numerous false alerts.

One feature that I was particularly excited about was the camera's ability to distinguish between people and pets. However, this feature was hit or miss. The camera often failed to recognize my pets, resulting in unnecessary alerts. It also had trouble distinguishing between people, often mistaking family members for strangers.

Another major issue I had with the RelaxCam was its lack of customer support. When I reached out to the company for help, I was met with generic responses that didn't address my specific concerns. It was clear that they weren't interested in providing any real assistance.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the RelaxCam. Its poor video quality, inconsistent motion detection, and lack of customer support make it a poor choice for anyone looking for a reliable home security solution. I would not recommend this camera to anyone and am giving it a 1-star rating.
